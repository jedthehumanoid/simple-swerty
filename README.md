# Simple Swerty

Original Swerty: http://johanegustafsson.net/projects/swerty/

Minor changes to original Swerty, for personal preferences

Works for Linux

## What is changed?

- Add `include "level3(ralt_switch)"` to symbols file, 
  AltGr key does not work for me otherwise
- Simplify. 
  Original Swerty has old AltGr mappings for convenience.
  This only makes me lazy, stopping me from learning.
- Based on US keyboard.
- Simple installer
